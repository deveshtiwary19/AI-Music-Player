# AI-Music-Player
Music player developed for android platform which works on Voice Commands

Following project is developed using JAVA.

The following application reads all the audio files from the android local storage that is from internal as well as External storrage.

It has three control buttons: Pause/Play,
next,
previous.

But the exiciting thing is that SPEECH RECOGNIZATION has been used in the application that makes the project more intrestiing.
The SPEECH RECOGNIZATION actually converts the voice of the speaker to the text format and hence check the conditions according to that commands.

So thats it!! Download the source code and use the idea in your project!!
